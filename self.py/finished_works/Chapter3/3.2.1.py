# Help the programmer to convert and print the opening words of the game "Taki" in its virtual version.
# You have at your disposal the original format of the opening words:

# "Shuffle, Shuffle, Shuffle", say it together! Change colors and directions, Don't back down and stop the player! Do you want to play Taki? Press y\n

# You must print the opening words in the following format (note that the last two lines start with two tabs each):
# "Shuffle, Shuffle, Shuffle", say it together!
# Change colors and directions,
# Don't back down and stop the player!
#         Do you want to play Taki?
#         Press y\n

# Guidelines
# The solution should include only one print line.
# Do not use triple quotes.
# Copy the string and ensure accurate output (spelling, punctuation, tabs and line breaks).
